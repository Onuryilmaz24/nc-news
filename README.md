# Front End NorthCoders News

--- 
Hey there, welcome to my News app Front End project!

I built this project as part of my JavaScript Software Development Bootcamp at Nortcoders. This React Based Web App that connects to the backend [API](https://github.com/Onuryilmaz24/nc-news-project) I previously developed. 

Key Features:

- **User-centric features:** Designed around user stories, the app delivers exactly what users need in an intuitive and interactive way.
- **Clean and reusable file structure:** Components are organized for maintainability and reusability, making it easy to scale and expand the project.
- **TailwindCSS:**  Leveraging Tailwind's utility-first approach, the app boasts a sleek, responsive, and flexible design.
- **React Router:** The app uses React Router to provide intuitive navigation, ensuring a fluid experience as users move between pages without unnecessary reloads.
- **Mobile-first design:** The app is optimized for a smooth experience on all devices, with a focus on mobile users.
